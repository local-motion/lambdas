# lambdas
Holds the code for the lambda functions used throughout the system

## Note on manually packaging lambda's
On MacOs systems use `zip -r ../filename.zip *` from the root folder (the one containing index.js) to create the zip file to upload to S3. Do not use the compress function in Finder.
